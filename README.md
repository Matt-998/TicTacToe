This is my Tic Tac Toe game. Had a fair bit of difficulty and confusion on this one but i've come out on the other side with a much better understanding of 
modular coding and now have the knowledge of how to better organise my code.
I used a few modules and closure to pass functions around the code base and make public and private functions. I'm happy with the overall result.
